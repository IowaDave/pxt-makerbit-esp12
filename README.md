## Interact with an 8266 Model ESP-12E or ESP-12F microcontroller

Note: The blocks and functions defined in this code are designed to communicate via serial with custom firmware installed on an Expressif 8266 microcontroller, in particular the models ESP-12E or -12F, mounted on a development module such as a NodeMCU or Wemos (Lolin) design.

You will need to install suitable firmware on the 8266 separately. An example can be found on github at [https://github.com/IowaDave/8266-Firmware-for-MakerBit](https://github.com/IowaDave/8266-Firmware-for-MakerBit).
