## Use as Extension

This repository can be added as an **extension** in MakeCode.

Note: it is designed to communicate via serial with custom firmware installed on an Expressif 8266 microcontroller, in particular the models ESP-12E or -12F, mounted on a development module such as a NodeMCU or Wemos (Lolin) design.

You will need to install the firmware on the 8266 separately. It can be found on github at [https://github.com/IowaDave/8266-Firmware-for-MakerBit](https://github.com/IowaDave/8266-Firmware-for-MakerBit).
